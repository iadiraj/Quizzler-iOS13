#  Quizzler

## Goal

The goal of this project is to take you one step further in my journey of becoming an iOS app developer. I used the mobile design pattern: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A design pattern is simply a repeatable and optimized solution to a common software problem and I've learned more about this when used in the project.

## What I created

You will program a trivia quiz app. If you have another field of expertise such as law or medicine, youâ€™ll be glad to know that multiple choice question apps are one of the most popular educational apps on the App Store! 

## What I have learned

* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Buttons.
* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming?
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Swift Structures and how to instantiate a struct instance.
* Understand the difference between value types and reference types. 
* Learn about Swift Classes and creating Objects.
* Compare Swift Classes with Swift Structs and know when to use which.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to refactor code and stay organized.
